In Spring Boot Microservices, the standard way to check the health of microservice is by using Spring Boot Actuator. THis is Industry-standard

There are 3 basic features of Spring Boot Actuator :

  -> EndPoints

  -> Metrics : SB Actuator provides dimensional metrics by integrating with the micrometer. 

  -> Autdit : Sb provides flexible audit framework that publishes events to Repo.

Endpoint : ALlows us to monitor and interact with the application, SB provides noof built-in endpoint, we can also create out own endpoint. 

The pre-defined endpoints are 

/health : Displays the health status of sb
/metrics : Provides details info about the sb
/loggers : Allows querying and modifying logging levels
/beans : Lists all spring beans in the application
/threaddump : Performs a thread dump of the JVM.
