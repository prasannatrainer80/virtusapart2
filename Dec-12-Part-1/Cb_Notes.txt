Spring Boot - Circuit Breaker Pattern with Resilience4j

Circuit breaker is a pattern that prevents cascading failures in microservices by stopping requests to a failing service once errors exceed a threshold, ensuring system stability with greatful fallbacks. Resilience4j is a lightweight java library inspired by Hystrix, offering circuit breaker, rate limiter, Bulkhead and Retry patterns for building resilient applications.




Circuit-Breaker acts as a fail-safe mechanism to prevent repeated from propagating in your system. It "breaks the circuit" when a service is unresponsive  consistently failing, allowing the system to fail fast and recover gracefully. 

How the Circuit Breaker Works 

	-> Closed State : All requests pass through, if failures reach a defined threshold, the circuit opens. 

	-> Open State : Requests are blocked, after a timeout, the circuit transitions to half-open

	-> Half-Open State : A limited no.of test requests are allowed, If successful, the circuit closes, if they fail it opens again

Benefits of Using Circuit Breakers 

	-> Prevents Cascading Failures : Isolates failures to avoid the chain reaction

	-> Graceful Degradation : Provides fallback responses to maintain a good user experience

	-> Improves the System Stability : Stops repeated attempts to execute failing operations. 

For Resilience4j 

  The key properties/parameters ar 

failureRateThreasHold : Percentage of failures before opening a circuit
SlidingWindowSize  Size of the sliding window for calculating failure rate.
minimumNumberOfCalls : Minimum requests before calculating failure rate.
waitDurationInOpenState : duration the circuit stays open before half-opening
permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState : Test Calls, allowed in half-open state.
