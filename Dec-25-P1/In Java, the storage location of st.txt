In Java, the storage location of static variables depends on the JVM version:

Before Java 8 (Java 7 and earlier)

Static variables were stored in the Method Area, which was part of the PermGen (Permanent Generation) space in JVM memory.

The PermGen space had a fixed size and could cause OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space if too many classes or static data were loaded.

Java 8 and Later

Static variables are now stored in the Heap (not in Metaspace).
Metaspace stores class metadata (information about the class structure, methods, etc.), but the actual static variable values live in the Java Heap.

Key Points

Static variables are created when the class is loaded by the ClassLoader.
They exist once per class, shared by all instances.
They are destroyed only when the class is unloaded (usually when the JVM shuts down or the classloader is garbage collected).
